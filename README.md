# Flowdocktee

Flowdocktee is a bash script that works like [tee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_(command))
command. It sends the standard input to flowdock instead of writing to files.

Flowdocktee is inspired by [slacktee](https://github.com/course-hero/slacktee)

## Requirements

Flowdocktee needs [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) to communicate with Flowdock.
